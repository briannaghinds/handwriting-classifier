IDEAS: have it start like a game (think of the room adventures (have an about me and get started)) <-- pop up windows
 - the canvas should be freeflowing and not pixelly
 - have a clear and done button
    - clear (clears the screen obvs) <-- should just overlay a new screen image
    - done takes a screenshot of the canvas to be run through the AI digit reader

PAINT GAME done
- implement a clear button function
- take the paint program and added it to the pygameTest script
